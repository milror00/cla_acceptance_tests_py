# Civil Legal Aid Acceptance Tests - Python example

This is an example project showing how to do an e2e test scenario using behave, selenium and python. It is the same project that was written in Java https://github.com/milror00/cla_acceptance_tests.

The current project is from a larger project that I completed for civil legal aid eligibility at the Ministry of Justice. The intention for this project is to provoke discussion with other developers and potential employers.

This project I tested on a windows 10 64 bit machine

Firefox 74.0 64 bit
Python 3.8

I use the PyCharm Professional IDE to develop my project.

Install the following libraries:

pip install behave
pip install selenium

or alternatively install from requirements.txt


If the above are installed then:

1. In your chosen IDE import this GIT project.

2. cd to cla_acceptance_tests_py

3. open a console and run behave ./features
